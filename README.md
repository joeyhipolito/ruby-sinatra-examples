# Ruby-Sinatra - examples

## Dependencies

* [Sinatra] (http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
* [Thin] (http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/)

It is not required to do this my way, and using Thin is completely optional, you can still run your code without having it installed.

## How to install dependencies

```ruby
gem install sinatra
gem install thin
```
## Run

```ruby
ruby [appname].rb -p 1337
```

`-p 1337` is optional, it is the port number where you would want your application to run
